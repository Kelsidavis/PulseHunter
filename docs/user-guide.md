- **Medium (50-79%)**: ðŸŸ¡ Possible detections, need review
- **Low (<50%)**: ðŸ”´ Uncertain, may be noise

## Observing Strategy

### Target Selection

**Good Targets:**
- Star-rich fields (Milky Way regions)
- Open clusters
- Known variable star fields
- Exoplanet host stars

**Avoid:**
- Empty sky regions
- Areas with bright planets
- Light-polluted fields
- Regions with many galaxies (for SETI)

### Observation Parameters

**Timing:**
- Minimum 1-2 hours per session
- Consistent cadence (same exposure interval)
- Monitor same field across multiple nights

**Exposure Settings:**
- Balance SNR vs. temporal resolution
- Typical: 30-120 seconds per frame
- Avoid saturation of bright stars
- Maintain consistent exposure times

**Environmental Conditions:**
- Stable atmospheric conditions preferred
- Avoid windy nights (tracking issues)
- Good seeing helps with photometry
- Dark sky locations yield better results

### Field Selection Strategy

**For SETI Detection:**
- Target nearby star systems
- Focus on Sun-like stars
- Monitor known exoplanet hosts
- Choose fields observable for long periods

**For Exoplanet Transits:**
- Known transit systems for confirmation
- TESS candidates needing follow-up
- Systems with favorable geometry
- Bright host stars (magnitude < 12)

## Data Processing

### Calibration Workflow

**Master Bias Creation:**
```
20-50 bias frames â†’ Master Bias
- Shortest possible exposure
- Same temperature as science frames
- Camera shutter closed
```

**Master Dark Creation:**
```
10-20 dark frames â†’ Master Dark
- Same exposure as science frames
- Same temperature as science frames
- Camera shutter closed
```

**Master Flat Creation:**
```
10-20 flat frames â†’ Master Flat
- Twilight sky or light panel
- Same filter as science frames
- Uniform illumination across field
```

### Detection Process

1. **Image Calibration**
   - Subtract master bias from all frames
   - Subtract master dark from all frames
   - Divide by normalized master flat

2. **Astrometric Calibration**
   - ASTAP plate solving for WCS
   - Enables coordinate determination
   - Required for catalog crossmatching

3. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Compute mean and standard deviation images
   - Calculate z-scores for each pixel
   - Identify outliers above threshold

4. **Candidate Filtering**
   - Reject detections near image edges
   - Filter elongated features (cosmic rays, satellites)
   - Apply confidence scoring

5. **Catalog Crossmatching**
   - Query GAIA DR3 for known stars
   - Check NASA Exoplanet Archive
   - Flag known variable stars

### Quality Control

**Automatic Checks:**
- Statistical significance testing
- Morphology filtering
- Edge rejection
- Catalog verification

**Manual Review:**
- Inspect high-confidence detections
- Check cutout images for artifacts
- Verify light curve behavior
- Cross-reference with observing logs

## Interpreting Results

### Understanding Detections

**Brightening Events âœ¨:**
- Possible optical flashes
- Stellar flares
- Asteroid occultation events
- Instrumental artifacts

**Dimming Events ðŸŒ‘:**
- Potential exoplanet transits
- Variable star minima
- Asteroid occultations
- Cloud interference

### Light Curve Analysis

**Good Detections Show:**
- Clear signal above noise
- Consistent behavior across frames
- Reasonable photometric values
- Expected temporal evolution

**Suspect Detections Show:**
- Single-frame spikes
- Extreme brightness values
- Irregular patterns
- Edge-of-field locations

### GAIA Cross-matching

**Known Star Match:**
- Likely instrumental or atmospheric effect
- Could be stellar variability
- Check known variable star catalogs
- May still be scientifically interesting

**No Match Found:**
- More interesting for SETI
